# SpawnreDJ

**SpawnreDJ** is a powerful and user-friendly tool designed to generate, analyze, and curate M3U playlists from a folder of audio files.  SpawnreDJ generates curated playlists based on detailed genre information and audio features, leveraging APIs from Last.fm, Spotify, & MusicBrainz.  In addition to outputting M3U playlist files, SpawnreDJ can also copy tracks listed in an M3U file and output them in sequence in a target directory (for example, to load onto a screen-free media player!)

## Prerequisites

Before installing **SpawnreDJ**, ensure you have the following:

- **API Keys:**
  - **Last.fm API Key:** Obtain one by creating an account at [Last.fm API](https://www.last.fm/api).
  - **Spotify API Credentials:** Obtain a Client ID and Client Secret by registering your application at [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications).

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the package using `pip`.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/SpawnID0000/SpawnreDJ.git
cd SpawnreDJ

# (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install the package along with its dependencies
pip install .
```

Alternatively, if **SpawnreDJ** is available on PyPI, you can install it directly:

```bash
pip install SpawnreDJ
```

## Configuration

Before using **SpawnreDJ**, you need to set up your API keys and secrets.

### 1. **Environment Variables (Recommended)**

Set your API credentials as environment variables to enhance security and prevent exposing sensitive information in command-line history.

**On Unix/Linux/macOS:**

```bash
export LASTFM_API_KEY="your_lastfm_api_key"
export SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID="your_spotify_client_id"
export SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET="your_spotify_client_secret"
```

**On Windows (Command Prompt):**

```cmd
set LASTFM_API_KEY=your_lastfm_api_key
set SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
set SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret
```

**On Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
$env:LASTFM_API_KEY="your_lastfm_api_key"
$env:SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID="your_spotify_client_id"
$env:SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET="your_spotify_client_secret"
```

### 2. **Passing API Credentials via Command Line**

If you prefer not to use environment variables, you can pass the API credentials directly in the command:

```bash
SpawnreDJ analyze /path/to/playlist.m3u /path/to/music_directory   -last your_lastfm_api_key   -spot your_spotify_client_id your_spotify_client_secret   [options]
```

**Note:** Be cautious when passing sensitive information via command line as it may be stored in shell history.

## Usage

**SpawnreDJ** is primarily used through the command line. Below are the common commands and options:

### 1. **Analyzing a Playlist**

Generate a CSV report by analyzing an existing M3U playlist.

```bash
SpawnreDJ analyze <path_to_m3u_file> <music_directory>   -last <lastfm_api_key>   -spot <spotify_client_id> <spotify_client_secret>   [options]
```

**Example:**

```bash
SpawnreDJ analyze /Users/toddmarco/Documents/playlist.m3u /Users/toddmarco/Documents/test_Music   -last e0986a4b591667fb3a2b9797e8450a70   -spot 7dcdbc03580d4a83826e5c2a7ef92244 c44b733461874a628ba7d825954fb679   -stats -features
```

### 2. **Options**

- `-stats`: Generate a statistics CSV summarizing genre distributions.
- `-features`: Fetch and append Spotify audio features to the CSV.
- `-analysis`: Fetch and append Spotify audio analysis data.
- `-post`: Use an existing CSV file for post-processing without extracting genres anew.
- `-q` or `--quiet`: Suppress logging output.
- `-v` or `--verbose`: Enable verbose logging for debugging purposes.
